# Maven Kata
**Note** This exercise is based on [Kuba Marchwicki's work](https://github.com/kubamarchwicki/maven-kata). All credits to him 

## Project structure

Project is build from three independent modules:

* calculator-api: provides a basic API for calculation
* calculator-test: verification code for the calculator

**NOTE from Codurance**: We don't encourage separation of testing codebase from the actual production code. The separation shown here is just for illustrative purposes

The assignment is to implement the calculator in a few, maven related steps (a little Java code with a lot of maven based steps).

## Pre requisites
Have maven installed locally at least, since some steps will be required before enabling the wrapper

## Exercises

### Clone the project

Clone the project into the local workspace 

```
git clone https://github.com/codurance/maven-katas.git
```

Jump to `multi-module` folder inside `maven-katas`

### Install locally

Install the `calculator-api` project locally by going inside the `calculator-api` folder and then execute

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### Create new project
Assuming you're still under the the `calculator-api` folder, we will create a new project based on `maven-archetype-quickstart`

```bash
./mvnw archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DoutputDirectory=../
```

Use the following parameters:
```
groupId: com.example.maven
artifactId: calculator
version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

### Enable maven wrapper
Go to the newly generated `calculator` module and run

```bash
mvn -N wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=3.2.3
```

This project can be easily imported to any IDE. 

* If you have installed the CLI tool of IntellliJ IDEA do 

```
idea .
```

* If not, simply use the File > Open... menu option from IDEA.

* In Eclipse just choose _Import_... > _Maven projects_ and choose _Existing Maven project_

### Adjust new project

In the generated project adjust the following:

* set java `source` and `target` runtime to Java 8.0
* change the default `junit` to latest available version (4.11 as of writing this document)
* add `calculator-api` as a dependency in the generated project

.dependencies
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.example.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>calculator-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

.java source
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.1</version>
  <configuration>
    <source>1.8</source>
    <target>1.8</target>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Java version can be set as `properties` as well (recommended)

.properties
```xml
<properties>
  <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
  <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

### Implement the calculator

And don't forget the tests!

Every time you add a new change to your production code, your test module won't know about it unless you 
recompile and make the update available for all consumers of your dependency. 

For that, run the project with 

```
./mvnw clean install
```
Every time you have a new change. Verify with your tests

### NOTES!!!
Careful with the reflection part. It expects to find an implementation in a very specific package
Also double-check your implementation of the calculator. If the IDE tells you it's too generic, make it less!

Speaking of IDE (IntelliJ in this case), if it isn't helping you too much, try adding each project as a maven project.
In order to achieve that, right click on the pom file, then `+ Add as Maven Project` 

### Test the reference

Check with the reference `calculator-test` project if everything works fine.

First build the project with skipping tests: `-DskipTest=true`

Depending which calculator you've implemented test it with run a desired test. For `Double` calculator run

```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=DoubleCalculatorTest
```

## Going multi module
Now that we've implemented the production code, you may have noticed how weird it was going back and forth between projects
So here comes a Parent POM to rescue

### Parent project generation
Go back to the one of the project folder (for instance `calculator`) and run the following command

```bash
./mvnw -B archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.maven -DartifactId=multi-module -DarchetypeArtifactId=pom-root -DarchetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes -DoutputDirectory=../../

```

Now go back to the `multi-module` folder and you'll see a `pom.xml` file
Enable the wrapper by running

```bash
mvn -N wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=3.2.3
```

### Create relationship

Open the `pom.xml` file and add the following after the `<name>multi-module</name>` tag

```xml
<modules>
    <module>calculator-api</module>
    <module>calculator</module>
    <module>calculator-test</module>
</modules>
```

And in each of the project's pom files add the following

```xml
<parent>
  <artifactId>multi-module</artifactId>
  <groupId>com.example.maven</groupId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</parent>
```

Now, your parent pom controls the other artifacts as submodules, and each submodule is declared to extend from the given parent


### Building from the parent pom

Now, you should be able to run

```bash
./mvnw clean package 
```

from the parent pom (`multi-module` folder)


## Managing dependencies from a parent

Now it is possible to manage dependencies in a more centralized way. In order to achieve that, we will make use of `dependencyManagement` and `dependencies` in the parent pom

### Dependency Management

Add the following snippet after the modules section and build again from the parent.
Everything should work as expected

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.example.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>calculator-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.example.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>calculator</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>junit</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
        <version>4.11</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.reflections</groupId>
        <artifactId>reflections</artifactId>
        <version>0.9.9-RC1</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Now you can go to each of your modules and remove the `version` tag from each declared dependency. 
The version will be provided by the parent 

## Common dependencies
Now it's possible to declare common dependencies in just one place, leaving place for cleaning and tidying up our modules

In order to achieve this, we will try it by adding the following snippet into our parent pom right after the `</dependencyManagement>` tag

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

With this in place, try to build again (everything should go OK!)

Now, let's go to the `calculator-test` module's pom.xml and remove the junit dependency

Try to build again, and everything should go fine

# Implications

With the latest steps, we were able to manage in a central place all the dependencies we want.
In an more enterprisey environment, this can save you a lot of time
